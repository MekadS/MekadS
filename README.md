- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MekadS
I am a Computer Science graduate from Meghalaya, and computers have fascinated me since I was young. After finishing my Bachelor's degree, I went on to complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. I'm currently enrolled in the MCA program at St. Anthony's College. My interests lie in Cyber Security, Computer Networking, and Data Analytics.

While pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from St Anthony's College, Shillong, I also interned as a Data Analyst for the District Covid Management Unit (DCMU) in 2021.
